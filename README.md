# General Assembly Coding Challenges
During the software engineering immersive at General Assembly, we were tasked with completing some coding challenges to supplement our learning. The following coding challenges are described and completed in the linked folder.
## sumNumber
* Write a function called sumNumbers that accepts a single array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers in the array.
* If the array is empty, return 0 (zero).
* [sumNumbers](sumNumbers/script.js)
## addList
* Write a function called addList that accepts any quantity of numbers as arguments, 
  adds them together and returns the resulting sum.
* Assume all parameters will be numbers.
* If called with no arguments, return 0 (zero).
* [addList](addList/script.js)
## findMax
* Write a recursive function that returns the max value in an array.
* [findMax](findMax/script.js)
## factorial
* Write a recursive function that returns the factorial of a given number.
* [factorial](factorial/script.js)
## fibonacci
* Write a function that returns the Nth number in the fibonacci sequence.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number
* For this function, the first two fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1.
* [fibonacci](fibonacci/script.js)
